##It's amazing, I want it!

First thing first, get a copy of this repo to your computer by clicking the `Download ZIP` button on the right or run `git clone https://github.com/jasonslyvia/alarm.git` command.

###Configuration

Then customize what features you want to use. Open `Gruntfile.js` with your favourite editor. Pay attention to the `alarm` part. All settings are commented so just modifiy them to suit your need.

```javascript
...
grunt.initConfig({
    alarm: {
      //make sure i18n/your_locale.json exists
      locale: 'zh_CN',

      //set the nav menu as desired
      nav: [{
        url: '/',
        title: 'Blog'
      },{
        url: '/works/',
        title: 'Works'
      },{
        url: '/about/',
        title: 'About'
      }],

      //there is a automatically generated nav item when user viewing
      //single article or static page, config it's title
      navContentTitle: 'Content',

      disqus: {
        enable: true,
        shortname: 'your_disqus_id_here'  //http://your_disqus_id_here.disqus.com should be your admin panel
      },

      googleAnalytics: {
        enable: true,
        id: 'your_GA_id_here'
      },

      syntaxHighlight: {
        enable: true
      },

      tableOfContent: {
        enable: true
      }
    }
...
```

### Build the theme

If you don't have `node` and `npm` installed, get them at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org). Then inside the `alarm` directory, run `npm install`, then run `grunt dist`.

Finally, the `dist` directory contained in `alarm` is your final ready-to-use theme, copy `dist` to your Ghost directory `/path-to-ghost/content/themes`, then rename it to `alarm`.

Restart your Ghost process and switch your theme to `alarm`.

Have fun!
